# David Chu's China Bistro
This repository contains multiple versions of a website designed for David Chu's China Bistro, showcasing its evolution over different iterations.

# Description
This project served as my final submission for the Coursera course "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers." It is a structured, multi-page, and fully responsive website created for a fictional restaurant. The design can be easily adapted as a template for restaurant portfolio websites.
The site presents key restaurant features such as the dining area, Google Maps integration, menu categories, business hours, and customer testimonials. Additionally, the Specials section dynamically refreshes with a randomly selected item every time the page loads, offering variety with each visitâ€”powered by JavaScript.
Designed with responsiveness in mind, the website adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes for a smooth browsing experience.

# Key Learnings
Developing with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
Applying media queries to ensure responsiveness
Utilizing Visual Studio Code and other essential development tools
